"Worthy mention: ""Felt agency"" - pretty much everyone felt agency at some point",,,,
aka they felt like they were the ones in charge of popping the ballon,,,,
(can go deeper into it i.e we deliberately lowered the threshold but dont wanna here),,,,

Also people surely noticed with false positives/false negatives,,,,https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lbn8rfw=/
aka really good that we did not use sham/fabricated input/output,,,,

"4 people think that SoO increases their SoA. However, some people also said that they felt their body betrayed them when the avatar did not squeeze the balloon.",,,,
This implies that those people also felt higher SoA through their SoO. So maybe the connection between SoO and SoA is stronger than originally thought,,,,
